# Liouville's theorem

Volume in phase space is conserved.

Time evolution is a series of canonical transformations, which leave phase space volume elements  $dγ\equiv \prod_i dq_i dp^i$  unchanged:$$dγ' = \prod_i dQ_i dP^i = \det(\boldsymbol{J})\prod_i dq_i dp^i$$You can prove that  $\det(\boldsymbol J)=1$ , so$$\boxed{dγ'=dγ}$$
