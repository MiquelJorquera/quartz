# Naimark's dilation theorem

There is a one-to-one correspondence between [spectral measures](Measure.md#^SpectralMeasure) $\P_\E:Σ\to\H'$ and [POVMs](Measure.md#^POVM) $\E:Σ\to B(\H),$ given by$$\E(X)=V^*\P_\E(X)V$$ for all $X\in Σ,$ and where $V:\H\to\H'$ is a linear [isometry](Morphisms.md#^Isometry), where $\H\subseteq\H'.$

The triple $(V,\H',\P_\E)$ is a *Naimark dilation* of $\E,$ and $\P_\E$ its *spectral dilation*. The projection $VV^*$ is the *Naimark projection*.

POVMs can arise from PVMs via projecting to a smaller Hilbert space
