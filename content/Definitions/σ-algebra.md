# $σ$-algebra
Set $\Sigma$ of [subsets](Set.md#^Subset) of a set $X$ that:
- Is closed under [complement](Set#^Complement)
- Contains $\varnothing$ (and thus $X$)
- Is closed under countable [unions](Set.md#^Union) (and thus countable [intersections](Set.md#^Intersection))
An element $σ\in Σ$ is called an *event*.

# Borel algebra

A *Borel algebra* is the smallest [$σ$-algebra](#$σ$-algebra) $\mathcal B(X)$ of a [topological space](Topology.md#^TopoSpace) $X$ which contains all [open](Topology.md#^OpenSet)/[closed](Topology.md#^ClosedSet) sets. ^BorelAlgebra

A *Borel set* is an element of a [Borel algebra](#^BorelAlgebra). ^BorelSet
