# Algebraic structure

An *algebraic structure* is a mathematical structure which consists of:
- A non-empty [[Set#Set|set]] $X.$
- A collection of [[Operation#^Closed|closed]] [[Operation#^Operation|finitary operations]] in $X.$
- A finite set of axioms.

Aside from these, we may also involve "auxiliary" algebraic structures, e.g. by equipping it with an [[Action#^RingAction|action]].

## Group-like
 
A *groupoid*, or *magma*, is an [[#Algebraic structure|algebraic structure]] with one [[Operation#^Closed|closed]] [[Operation#^Operation2|binary operation]]. ^Magma

A *semigroup* is an [[#Algebraic structure|algebraic structure]] with one [[Operation#^Closed|closed]], [[Operation#^Associativity|associative]] [[Operation#^Operation2|binary operation]]. ^Semigroup

A *monoid* is an [[#Algebraic structure|algebraic structure]] with one [[Operation#^Closed|closed]], [[Operation#^Associativity|associative]] [[Operation#^Operation2|binary operation]] and an [[Operation#^Identity|identity element]]. Usually thought of as a "[[#^Group|group]] without an [[Operation#^Inverse|inverse]]". ^Monoid

A *group* $(G,·)$ is an [[#Algebraic structure|algebraic structure]] with one [[Operation#^Closed|closed]], [[Operation#^Associativity|associative]] [[Operation#^Operation2|binary operation]], an [[Operation#^Identity|identity element]], and an [[Operation#^Inverse|inverse]] for all $g\in G.$  ^Group

An *abelian group*, or *commutative group* $(G,+)$, is a [[#^Group|group]] whose [[Operation#^Operation2|operation]] $+$ [[Operation#^Commutativity|commutes.]]  ^CommGroup

The *trivial group*, or *zero group* $\{e\}$ is the [group](#^Group) that contains only the [identity element](Operation.md#^Identity).
All trivial groups are [isomorphic](Morphisms.md#^Isomorphism).
The trivial group is a [subgroup](#^Subgroup) of every group. ^TrivialGroup

A *topological group* is a [[Topology#^TopoSpace|topological space]] that is also a [[#^Group|group]], such that the group operation and the [[Operation#^Inverse|inversion map]] are [[Function#^ContinuousFunction|continuous]]. ^TopoGroup

A [[#^TopoGroup|topological group]] is *commutative* if its underlying topological space is [[#^CommGroup|commutative]]. ^CommTopoGroup

A [[#^TopoGroup|topological group]] is *locally compact* if its underlying topological space is [[Topology#^LocallyCompact|locally compact]] and [[Topology#^Hausdorff|Hausdorff]]. ^LocCompTopoGroup

A *subgroup* $(H,·)\leq (G,·)$ of a [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ is a group where $H$ is a [subset](Set.md#^Subset) of $G,$ and whose group operation is the same as that of $(G,·).$ ^Subgroup

The *trivial subgroup* $\{e\}$ of a [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ is the [subgroup](#^Subgroup) that only contains the [identity element](Operation.md#^Identity) of $(G,·).$
It carries no information about $(G,·),$ because all [trivial groups](#^TrivialGroup) are [isomorphic](Morphisms.md#^Isomorphism). ^TrivialSubgroup

A *proper subgroup* $(H,·)<(G,·)$ of a [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ is a group where $H$ is a [proper subset](Set.md#^ProperSubset) of $G,$ and whose group operation is the same as that of $(G,·).$
Sometimes the [trivial subgroup](#^TrivialSubgroup) is excluded. ^ProperSubgroup

A *normal subgroup* $(N,·)\trianglelefteq (G,·)$ of a [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ is a [subgroup](#^Subgroup) of $(G,·)$ such that for all $g\in G:$$$g·N=N·g$$If $(G,·)$ is [commutative](#^CommGroup), every subgroup is normal. ^NormalSubgroup

A [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ is *simple* if its only [normal subgroups](#^NormalSubgroup) are itself and the [trivial group](#^TrivialGroup). ^SimpleGroup

A *(left/right) coset* $g_iH$ of a [subgroup](#^Subgroup)  $(H,·)\leq (G,·)$  is a [set](Set.md#Set) generated by (left/right) multiplying a fixed  $G\ni g_i\notin H$ by every  $h\in H$  .
Because of [Lagrange's theorem](Lagrange's%20theorem.md#Lagrange's%20Theorem), cosets are [disjoint](Set.md#^Disjoint) and equal-sized: [Picture](foo.png) ^Coset

The *quotient group*, or *factor group*, $(G/N,·)$ of a [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ by a [normal subgroup](#^NormalSubgroup) $(N,·)\trianglelefteq (G,·),$ is the group formed by the [cosets](#^Coset) of $(N,·)$ and the same group operation $·.$
In general, $(G/N,·)\nleq (G,·).$ ^QuotientGroup

The *order* $|G|$ of a [group](#^Group) $(G,·)$ is the [cardinality](Set.md#^Cardinality) of $G.$
For finite groups, it's just its number of elements. ^GroupOrder

### Groups

The *circle group* $(S^1,·)$ is the multiplicative [[#^Group|group]] of [[Vector space#^UnitVector|unit]] complex numbers:$$S^1\equiv \big\{ z\in\C\ \big|\ |z|=1 \big\}$$ ^CircleGroup

The *Pontryagin dual* $\widehat{G}$ of a [[#^LocCompTopoGroup|locally compact]] [[#^CommTopoGroup|commutative group]] $G,$ is the [[#^Group|group]] of [[Function#^ContinuousFunction|continuous]] [[Morphisms#^Homomorphism|homomorphisms]] $\widehat G:G\to S^1$ to the [[#^CircleGroup|circle group]] $S^1.$ ^PontryaginDual

A *field* $(F,+,\times)$ is a [[#^CommRing|commutative]] [[#^Ring|ring]] where $I_+\equiv 0\neq 1\equiv I_\times,$ and all non-zero elements have a multiplicative [[Operation#^Inverse|inverse]]. ^Field

A *(left) ideal* of a [ring](#^Ring) $(R,+,\times)$ is a [subset](Set.md#^Subset) $I\subseteq R$ such that for all $r\in R:$$$\begin{split}
(I,+)&\trianglelefteq(R,+)\\
r\times I&=I
\end{split}$$If  $I$  is an ideal, we can form the [quotient ring](Topology.md#^QuotientSpace) of [cosets](#^Coset)  $R/I.$ ^Ideal

The *characteristic* of a [ring](#^Ring) is the smallest number of 1's that sum to 0. If you can't, the characteristic is 0.

Usually, "the Lie algebra" refers to the Lie bracket relations of the basis generators. ^LieAlgebra

The *universal enveloping algebra* $U(\g)$  of a [Lie algebra](#^LieAlgebra) $\g$  is the largest [associative algebra](#^AssAlgebra) generated by the elements of   $\g$ with basis $X_i,$ such that if
$$[X_i,X_j]=c^{ijk}X_k$$
then   $U(\g)$ is generated by   $x_i$ such that 
$$x_ix_j - x_jx_i = c^{ijk}x_k$$
*and no other relations*. This is the relationship between [Lie brackets](Linear%20map.md#^LieBracket) and commutators. ^UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra


The *Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula* is the solution $Z$ to the equation $e^Xe^Y=e^Z$ for possibly [[Operation#^Commutativity|noncommutative]] $X,Y$ in a [[#^LieAlgebra|Lie algebra]] of a [[|Lie group]]. Its first few terms are$$Z=X+Y+\frac12[X,Y]+\frac1{12}[X,[X,Y]]-\frac1{12}[Y,[X,Y]]+\dots$$ In the common case that $[X,Y]$ commutes with $X,Y$, we get:$$e^Xe^Y=e^{X+Y+\frac12[X,Y]}$$ ^BCH-Formula
