# Classical mechanics

Classical mechanics takes place in Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$ with its Euclidean translation and roflation symmetry group $E^3.$ 

We also want functions in this space, so we add the [tangent bundle](Fiber%20bundle.md#^TangentBundle) $T\mathbb{E}^3,$ and we call it the ([dual](Vector%20space.md#^DualSpace)) *momentum space*. Tangent spaces at all points are also Euclidean, so the total symmetry group for physical systems in $\mathbb{E}^3$ is the Galilean group $G^3,$ which includes Galilean boosts.
